Decentralized Voting System

Overview

This is a decentralized voting system deployed on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. It allows users to securely vote for candidates, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof results. The system is integrated with a frontend dApp, allowing users to interact with the contract via Web3.js.

Features

Voting: Users can vote for a selected candidate.

Candidate Management: Candidates can be added and retrieved from the blockchain.

Voting Closure: The system can close voting by the owner.

Transparency: Votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.

Technologies

Solidity: Smart contract development

Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API

HTML/CSS: Frontend for user interaction

Setup

Install Dependencies:
Web3.js library for connecting to Ethereum.

MetaMask extension to interact with the blockchain.

Deploy Smart Contract: Deploy the smart contract on an Ethereum test network or mainnet.

Run the dApp: Open the HTML file in a browser with MetaMask enabled.

How to Use

Vote: Select a candidate from the dropdown and click "Vote".

Close Voting: The owner can close voting using the "Close Voting" button.

Security & Audits
